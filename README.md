# Simple Langchain Index Demo

> This README was autogenerated with GPT-4

This repository demonstrates a simple way to create and query a Langchain index using `create-index.py` and `query-index.py`. Langchain is a powerful tool for indexing and querying text documents, leveraging state-of-the-art language models and embeddings to enable efficient information retrieval and question-answering capabilities.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or later
- langchain (install with `pip install langchain`)
- An OpenAI API key (get one from https://beta.openai.com/signup/)

## Files

- `create-index.py`: This script creates a Langchain index using the Chroma vector store. It loads the text documents, splits them into chunks, generates embeddings, and stores the data in a persistent directory.
- `query-index.py`: This script queries the Langchain index created in `create-index.py`, returning relevant information based on the input query.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository and navigate to the directory.

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simple-langchain-index-demo.git
cd simple-langchain-index-demo
```

2. Install the required packages.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

3. Set up the environment variable for the OpenAI API key.

```
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

4. Create the Langchain index by running `create-index.py`.

```
python create-index.py
```

5. Query the index by running `query-index.py`.

```
python query-index.py
```
